# Flink Snippet

This is a collection of codes related to apache-flink.
This is also an experiment lab for me to study flink.
It includes some examples currently. In the near future, I will introduce more experiments...


## How To Compile

Run ```sbt assembly``` to compile, run tests and package all sub-projects.

If you want to operate specific sub-project, use ```project``` command in sbt shell to switch sub-project:
```shell
> projects          // list all sub-projects
> project examples  // switch to 'examples' sub-project
> project all       // switch to 'all' project which including all sub-projects
```
